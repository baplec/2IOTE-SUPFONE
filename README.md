Topic reminder :
SUPFONE is a business communication service inspired by Nokia 3310 and SMS. You will be greatly influenced by some of the mechanics of this iconic phone.

It has to be realized by groups of maximum 2 students in 2 weeks, and is mostly based on what you have seen during this course but some parts may need a little research to complete. One and only one group of 3 is allowed if and only if the class has an odd number of students and all other groups have 2 members.
